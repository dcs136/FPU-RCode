First let us load the packages we will use in this lab, as well as the data set 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
vg_path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reisanar/datasets/master/video_game_sales.csv"
vg_sales <- read_csv(vg_path)
```

Let us use the `glimpse()` function to learn more about the type of variables included in this data frame.

```{r}
glimpse(vg_sales)
```

**Video Games Sales**

The dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. (Data frame was retrieved from <vgchartz.com>, and includes records of Sales from release until 10/26/2016).

Fields include

`Rank` - Ranking of overall sales

`Name` - The games name

`Platform` - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)

`Year` - Year of the game's release

`Genre` - Genre of the game

`Publisher` - Publisher of the game

`NA_Sales` - Sales in North America (in millions)

`EU_Sales` - Sales in Europe (in millions)

`JP_Sales` - Sales in Japan (in millions)

`Other_Sales` - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)

`Global_Sales` - Total worldwide sales.


Print the data set :

```{r}
vg_sales
```


## Filter

Notice that the variable `Year` is of class character in this dataset.

- Filter games published in 2008

```{r}

```


- Filter games in 2008 with `Global_Sales` higher or equal than 10 (million)

```{r}

```

- Filter results for "FIFA Soccer 08"

```{r}

```

## Mutate


Create a new column that confirms that the number of `Global_Sales` matches the addition of the reported number of sales in the different regions

```{r}

```






## Arrange

Sort the video games by number of global sales, and break any ties by year of release

```{r}

```


## Using the pipe operator with `group_by()` and `summarise()`


**Summary by Platform**

Use the pipe operator, `%>%`, and the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions to create a summary of sales per platform 
_(Hint: `sum(v)`  adds up all the elements in the vector `v`)_

```{r}




```


**Summary by Genre**


Use the pipe operator, `%>%`, and the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions to create a summary of sales per genre 

```{r}



```



#### To remember

dplyr verbs     |Description
----------------|------------------------------
`select()`      |	select columns
`filter()`      |	filter rows
`arrange()`     |	re-order or sort rows
`mutate()`      |	create new columns
`summarise()`   |	summarise values
`group_by()`    |	allows for group operations
