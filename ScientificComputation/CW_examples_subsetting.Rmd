If `i` is positive and exceeds `length(x)` then the corresponding selection is `NA`
(see <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-lang.html#Indexing>)

```{r}
x <- c(2,5,NA)
# print x
x
# out-of-bounds index

```


This applies to "indexing of simple vectors". 

When a subscript contains values that are not present in the object, the results
vary depending on the context:

- In a vector: 

```{r}
# named vector
w1 <- c(b = 1,c = 2)
# print vector
w1
# attempt to extract nonexistent value
w1

```


```{r}
w1
```


- In a list:

```{r}
# define list
w2 <- list(b = 10, c = 20)

# print list
w2
# attempt to extract nonexistent value
w2['a']

```

- In a matrix:

```{r}
# define matrix
M1 <- matrix(c(2, - 3, 0,1,2),2,2) 
# print matrix
M1
# attempt to extract nonexistent column

M1[,3]
# attempt to extract nonexistent row
M1[10,]
```

- In a dataframe:

```{r}
# define dataframe
df1 <- data.frame(lastname = c("Sanches", "Jones"), 
                  gpa = c(4.0, 3.9),
                  stringsAsFactors = F)
# print dataframe
df1
```

```{r}
# attempt to extract nonexistent column
df1 [,"major"]

df1

```

```{r}
# attempt to extract nonexistent row



```


## Subsetting

Adapted from <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html>

- There are several ways to subset _atomic vectors_.

- There are three subsetting operators, `[[`, `[`, and `$`.

- Subsetting operators interact differently with different vector types (e.g., atomic vectors, lists, factors, matrices, and data frames).

- Subsetting can be combined with assignment.



### Atomic vectors

```{r}
x <-c(2.1,4.2,3.3,5.4) 

x 
```

(Note that the number after the decimal point represents the original position in the vector)

There are several things that you can use to subset a vector:

- Positive integers return elements at the specified positions:

```{r}

x[c(1,3)]

```

```{r}
# Duplicate indices will duplicate values
x[c(1,1)]

```

- Negative integers exclude elements at the specified positions:

```{r}

x[-c(1,3)]

```

(you can't mix positive and negative integers in a single subset)


- Logical vectors select elements where the corresponding logical value is `TRUE`.

```{r}
x[c(T,F,F,T)]

```

```{r}

x [x > 3]

```


In `x[y]`, what happens if `x` and `y` are different lengths? The behaviour is controlled by the _recycling rules_ where the shorter of the two is recycled to the length of the longer. 

Note that a missing value in the index always yields a missing value in the output:

```{r}


```

- Nothing returns the original vector.

```{r}

```

- Zero returns a zero-length vector. 

```{r}

```

- If the vector is _named_, you can also use character vectors to return elements with matching names.

```{r}
y <- 
y
```

```{r}
# subset using names

```


(when subsetting with `[`, names are always matched exactly)

```{r}
z <- c
z
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

### Data frames

Data frames have the characteristics of both lists and matrices:

- When subsetting with a single index, they behave like lists and index the columns, so `df[1:2]` selects the first two columns.

- When subsetting with two indices, they behave like matrices, so `df[1:3, ]` selects the first three rows (and all the columns)


```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = c(10,20,30),
                y = 3:1,
                z = letters[1:3]
                )
                
                
df
```

```{r}
# subsetting: get row for which x == 2
df[df$x == 20, ]

```

```{r}
# get rows 1 and 3
df[c(1,3),]

```

Two ways of selecting columns from a dataframe: 

- like a list:

```{r}

df$x

```

- like a matrix:

```{r}


```


```{r}
COP <- matrix(c(10,-10,1,2,3,4),3,2)

COP[c(1,3) ,2]


```
```{r}
COP[COP > 4] <- 207


```




## Selecting a single element

There are two other subsetting operators: `[[` and `$`. `[[` is used for extracting single items, while `x$y` is a useful shorthand for `x[["y"]]`.


### `[[`

`[[` is most important when working with lists because subsetting a list with `[` always returns a smaller list. 

```{r}
x <- 
x
```

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1f648d451974f0ed313347b78ba653891cf59b21/8185b/diagrams/subsetting/train.png)

<https://adv-r.hadley.nz/subsetting.html>

```{r}


```

Because `[[` can return only a single item, you must use it with either a single positive integer or a single string. If you use a vector with `[[`, it will subset recursively, i.e. `x[[c(1, 2)]]` is equivalent to `x[[1]][[2]]`.

```{r}

```

While you must use `[[` when working with lists, it is also recommend using it with atomic vectors whenever you want to extract a single value. For example, instead of writing:

```{r}
# for (i in 2:length(x)) {
#   out[i] <- fun(x[i], out[i - 1])
# }
```

it's better to write:

```{r}
# for (i in 2:length(x)) {
#   out[[i]] <- fun(x[[i]], out[[i - 1]])
# }
```

Doing so reinforces the expectation that you are getting and setting individual values.

### `$`

`$` is a shorthand operator: `x$y` is roughly equivalent to `x[["y"]]`. 



```{r}

```


```{r}

```


```{r}

```
